# Vision

Some features are unavailable in the GA4 user interface but can be done using public APIs.

Features that are not covered by official clients like Looker Studio or [Google Analytics Utilities](https://github.com/google/google-analytics-utilities) are leaving room for opportunities (example: monitor property configurations and alert when changes occur).

Such features can be developped with custom scripts or no/low-code tools, however the technical barrier remains high to most users.

A micro SaaS with an clean user interface removes that barrier.

# Pricing

## Model

Subscripition: 1 
Usage: easier to convert users, but harder to implement and predict revenue.

Every user can access all features.

1 property check can cost $0.10

## Strategy

At least 2 tiers are required, with a maximum of 4 tiers showed at once to reduce complexity.

The pricing can be based on the following levers:

- Number of properties
- Number of features
- Number of users

Start simple without team or multi-user features, and add them later.
